To install the specified Python libraries (`sentence-transformers`, `transformers`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`), you can use the following terminal commands:

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers transformers pandas scikit-learn
```

### Explanation:
- **`pip install`**: This is the command used to install Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
- **`sentence-transformers`**: A library for state-of-the-art sentence, text, and image embeddings.
- **`transformers`**: A library by Hugging Face for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, etc.
- **`pandas`**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- **`scikit-learn`**: A library for machine learning, providing tools for data mining and data analysis.

### Additional Notes:
- If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before running the command.
- If you encounter any issues with dependencies, you can try upgrading `pip` first:

  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

- If you are using Python 3 specifically and `pip` is not recognized, you might need to use `pip3` instead:

  ```bash
  pip3 install sentence-transformers transformers pandas scikit-learn
  ```
